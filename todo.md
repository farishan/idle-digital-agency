# Incremental Game: Digital Agency - TODO

## Initial Setup
- [x] Create a GitHub repository for the project.
- [x] Set up the development environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [ ] Avoid using 3rd-party libraries if possible.
- [x] Write an initial README with project overview and goals.

## Core Game Design
- [ ] Define game resources:
  - [ ] Money
  - [ ] Reputation
  - [ ] Time
- [ ] Create a progression map:
  - [ ] Early game: Freelance gigs.
  - [ ] Mid-game: Scaling to a small agency.
  - [ ] Late game: Automation and global dominance.
- [ ] Brainstorm random events and challenges:
  - [ ] Market trends.
  - [ ] Client demands.
  - [ ] Internal team crises.

## Gameplay Features
- [ ] Basic project system:
  - [ ] Project generation with attributes (difficulty, reward, deadline).
  - [ ] Resource allocation mechanics (assign team members).
  - [ ] Success/failure outcomes.
- [ ] Team management:
  - [ ] Hiring and firing.
  - [ ] Skills and leveling up.
  - [ ] Salaries and morale.
- [ ] Client system:
  - [ ] Randomized clients with unique requirements.
  - [ ] Reputation-based unlocks.

## Incremental Mechanics
- [ ] Automations:
  - [ ] Develop upgrades for workflow automation.
  - [ ] Introduce passive income streams.
- [ ] Prestige system:
  - [ ] Define prestige mechanics (e.g., restart with bonus multipliers).
  - [ ] Create incentives for replayability.

## User Interface
- [ ] Wireframe basic layouts:
  - [ ] Resource overview panel.
  - [ ] Project management dashboard.
  - [ ] Upgrade and team management menus.
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for actions:
  - [ ] Progress bars.
  - [ ] Notifications (e.g., project completed, event triggered).
- [ ] Add theme-appropriate design (modern agency aesthetic).

## Technical Implementation
- [ ] Game loop structure:
  - [ ] Define incremental logic for resource generation.
  - [ ] Implement time-based mechanics.
- [ ] Save system:
  - [ ] Enable local storage for progress persistence.
  - [ ] Optional cloud save integration.
- [ ] Modular architecture for scalability.

## Testing and Iteration
- [ ] Write unit tests for core mechanics.
- [ ] Playtest for balance:
  - [ ] Adjust project difficulty and rewards.
  - [ ] Balance resource generation.
- [ ] Gather feedback from early players.

## Release and Marketing
- [ ] Create a landing page for the game.
- [ ] Prepare promotional materials:
  - [ ] Screenshots and videos.
  - [ ] Dev blog posts.
- [ ] Launch on itch.io and Steam.
- [ ] Collect and respond to user feedback for updates.
